  <h1>Retail Sector Scoring Report</h1>

  <section class="summary">
    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>
      This report evaluates selected UK retail sectors across three dimensions: <strong>resilience</strong>, <strong>volatility</strong>, and <strong>ethical alignment</strong>. Resilience measures the percentage change in Value Index from 2020 to 2025, indicating how well each sector recovered post-pandemic. Volatility is assessed via the standard deviation of Volume Index, capturing fluctuations in consumer activity. Ethical alignment is manually scored based on sector mappings to culturally embedded and locally oriented subclusters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The updated scoring heatmap and dashboard visualisations reveal a more nuanced picture. <strong>Specialist Food Stores</strong> consistently rank high in both resilience and ethical alignment, while <strong>Mail Order</strong> shows low resilience and ethical value despite stable volatility. <strong>Books, Newspapers & Periodicals</strong> demonstrate moderate resilience but high ethical alignment, reinforcing their cultural significance. <strong>Footwear and Leather Goods</strong> show strong resilience but lower ethical scores, suggesting commercial recovery without deep local embedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      These insights support targeted policy and investment decisions, highlighting sectors that combine economic recovery with ethical value. The scoring framework balances quantitative metrics with qualitative interpretation, offering a transparent and accessible tool for strategic evaluation.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted retail activity across the UK, prompting shifts in consumer behaviour, supply chains, and sector performance. As the economy stabilises, understanding which sectors have recovered — and which align with ethical and cultural priorities — is essential for guiding investment, policy, and innovation. This report focuses on four sectors: Mail Order, Specialist Food Stores, Footwear and Leather Goods, and Books, Newspapers & Periodicals.

    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <p>
      We used the Office for National Statistics Retail Sales Index (ONS RSI) to analyse Value and Volume Index trends from 2019 to 2025. Resilience was calculated as the percentage change in Value Index from 2020 to 2025. Volatility was measured using the standard deviation of Volume Index across the same period. Ethical alignment scores were manually assigned based on sector mappings to Pen Portrait subclusters, reflecting cultural embeddedness and local orientation.
    </p>
    <p>
      All scores were ranked manually to ensure consistency across visualisations. The final scoring table and heatmap use integer scores from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest), aligned with the dashboard bar charts.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      This scoring framework highlights the complexity of post-pandemic recovery. Sectors like Specialist Food Stores demonstrate both economic resilience and ethical strength, while others like Mail Order show stability but limited cultural alignment. By combining quantitative metrics with qualitative insights, this report offers a balanced perspective for decision-makers seeking to support sustainable and locally embedded retail growth.
