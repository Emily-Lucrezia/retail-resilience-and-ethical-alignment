    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>
      This report analyses the resilience, volatility, and ethical alignment of selected UK retail sectors. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Resilience measures the percentage change in Value Index from 2020 to 2025, indicating how well each sector has recovered post-pandemic. Volatility is analysed through the standard deviation of Volume Index, by capturing fluctuations in consumer activity. Ethical alignment is manually scored based on sector mappings to culturally embedded and locally oriented subclusters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scoring heatmap and dashboard visualisations reveal a more detailed picture. Mail Order shows a relatively high resilience (score 4), moderate volatility (score 2), and the lowest ethical alignment (score 1); this suggests commercial strength, without strong ties to local culture or community values. Specialist Food Stores exhibit moderate resilience (score 2), lowest volatility (score 1), and the highest ethical alignment (score 5); this indicates a strong local relevance despite a slower recovery. Books, Newspapers and Periodicals show a balanced performance in all dimensions, with moderate resilience (score 3), high volatility (score 4), and strong ethical alignment (score 4); this reinforces their cultural significance. Footwear and Leather Goods score the lowest in resilience (score 1) and have a relatively low ethical alignment (score 2), but show moderate volatility (score 3); this suggests that recovery is driven more by market dynamics than local values.
    </p>
    <p>
      These insights support targeted policy and investment decisions, highlighting sectors that balance economic performance with ethical and cultural values. The scoring framework combines quantitative metrics with qualitative interpretation to provide a resource for strategic assessment.

  <section id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted retail activity across the UK, causing changes in consumer behaviour, supply chains, and sector performance. As the economy is stabilising, it's essential to understand which sectors have recovered and which align with ethical and cultural priorities for guiding investment, policy, and innovation. This report focuses on four sectors: Mail Order, Specialist Food Stores, Footwear and Leather Goods, and Books, Newspapers and Periodicals. These industries were selected as they represent a mix of commercial models and cultural relevance, making them ideal for evaluating post-pandemic recovery through data.
    </p>

  <section id="methods">
    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <p>
      The Office for National Statistics Retail Sales Index (ONS RSI) was used to analyse Value and Volume Index trends from 2019 to 2025. Resilience was calculated as the percentage change in Value Index from 2020 to 2025. Volatility was measured using the standard deviation of Volume Index over the same period. Ethical alignment scores were manually assigned based on sector mappings to Pen Portrait subclusters, reflecting cultural embeddedness and local orientation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sector typology was derived by mapping RSI categories to Pen Portrait clusters and subclusters. This allowed for the interpretation of ethical alignment in terms of cultural and local relevance.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> The Pen Portraits dataset is based on the 2018 town centre typologies and is used as a static reference to interpret ethical alignment. RSI data (2013–2025) provides sector performance metrics for resilience and volatility scoring.

  <section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      This scoring framework emphasises the complexity of post-pandemic retail recovery. Specialist Food Stores stand out for their ethical strength and stability, while Books, Newspapers and Periodicals offer a culturally rich but highly volatile profile. Mail Order shows strong resilience but low ethical alignment, instead Footwear and Leather Goods show low recovery and cultural relevance. 
    </p>
    <p>
      By combining quantitative metrics with qualitative insights, this report offers a balanced perspective for decision-makers seeking to support sustainable, locally embedded retail growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Recommended next steps:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Expand the scoring framework to more sectors and updating the ethical alignment mapping using more recent town centre data.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prioritise investment and policy support for sectors that show both ethical alignment and stability, such as Specialist Food Stores and Books, Newspapers and Periodicals, to reinforce cultural relevance and long-term resilience.
      </li>
    </ul>
