# Mapping Retail Resilience and Ethical Alignment in Post-Pandemic UK Town Centres

Welcome to the GitHub Pages site for my capstone project, part of the **Professional Certificate in Data Analytics**. This project investigates how UK retail sectors have evolved from 2013 to 2025, with a particular focus on **post-pandemic recovery** and **ethical alignment**.

## Project Overview

Using the **Office for National Statistics’ Retail Sales Index (RSI)** and a typology of town centre identities, I developed a scoring framework to evaluate:

- **Resilience**: Sector recovery from 2020 to 2025
- **Volatility**: Fluctuations in consumer activity
- **Ethical Alignment**: Cultural and local relevance based on subcluster mapping

The goal is to support **data-driven planning decisions** that balance economic recovery with cultural and social value.

## Key Features

- **Executive Summary**: Clear overview of research questions, findings, and recommendations
- **Interactive Visuals**: Sector scoring heatmaps, RSI trends, and typology mappings
- **Transparent Methodology**: Step-by-step explanation of data sources, cleaning, and scoring logic
- **Accessible Design**: Responsive layout with high-contrast visuals, readable fonts, and keyboard-friendly navigation

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python**: Data cleaning, scoring logic, and visualizations
- **HTML & CSS**: Custom GitHub Pages layout and styling
- **ONS RSI & Pen Portraits**: Primary data sources for sector performance and typology mapping
