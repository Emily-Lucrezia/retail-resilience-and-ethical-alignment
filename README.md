# Mapping Retail Resilience and Ethical Alignment in Post-Pandemic UK Town Centres

Welcome to the GitHub Pages site for my capstone project, part of the Professional Certificate in Data Analytics. This project explores how retail sectors in the UK have evolved from 2013 to 2025, with a focus on post-pandemic recovery and ethical alignment.

## Project Overview

Using the Office for National Statistics’ Retail Sales Index (RSI) and a typology of town centre identities, I developed a scoring framework to evaluate sector-level resilience, volatility, and ethical alignment. The goal is to support data-driven planning decisions that balance economic recovery with cultural and social value.

## Key Features

- **Executive Summary**: A concise overview of the research question, findings, and recommendations.
- **Interactive Visuals**: Sector scoring heatmaps, price index trends, and typology mappings.
- **Methodology**: Clear explanation of data sources, cleaning steps, and analytical logic.
- **Accessible Design**: Fully responsive layout with accessible fonts, color contrast, and navigation.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Data cleaning, scoring logic, and visualizations
- **HTML & CSS**: Custom GitHub Pages layout
- **ONS RSI & Pen Portraits**: Primary data sources
